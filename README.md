The Good Project

Government agencies spend millions annually on fragmented, expensive cloud storage while struggling to provide transparent, accessible public data. Current solutions create vendor lock-in and require technical expertise that most civic organizations don't possess.

The Government Onchain Open Data (GOOD) Project proposes to create the first user-friendly platform enabling any civic technologist or government employee to upload public datasets to Filecoin's decentralized network with simple drag-and-drop functionality—no blockchain expertise required.

GOOD provides a living repository where data updates automatically while preserving immutable historical versions, supporting both real-time government operations and permanent public accountability.

Our technical evaluation of Filecoin storage solutions demonstrates that decentralized storage can reduce government storage costs while eliminating vendor dependencies. However, adoption requires accessible tools—the critical gap our platform addresses. A platform must enable, for example, a city clerk to preserve budget documents without understanding blockchain mechanics.

**Democratic Benefits**
*Transparency:* Citizens can independently verify data integrity through blockchain proofs

*Permanence:* No single entity can delete or modify public records

*Accessibility:* Standardized platform reduces costs for smaller municipalities

*Sovereignty:* Government data remains under public control, not corporate platforms

*Funding:* Funding is not requested in this report, but would be required would to develop a production-ready prototype, conduct user testing with civic organizations, and host community data-thons to demonstrate real-world adoption.

A scalable platform democratizes access to decentralized storage for government entities of all sizes, creating a foundation for transparent, cost-effective, and permanently accessible public data infrastructure.
